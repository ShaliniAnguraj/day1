Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
  
Ans:HTTP/1.1
      * It the usest works on the textual format.
      * There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
      * It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.	
      * It uses HPACK for data compression.

HTTP/2
      * It works on the binary protocol.
      * It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
      * It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
      * It compresses data by itself.	


2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects: 
      * A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method).
        (for example: A cup is an object, with properties>> A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc).
      * The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
      * JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript.
      * JavaScript is template based not class based. Here, we don't create class to get the object.we direct create objects.
     
Creating Objects in JavaScript:
      * By object literal
      * By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
      * By using an object constructor (using new keyword)

By object literal:
      
      syntax
                  
                  object={property1:value1,property2:value2.....propertyN:valueN}  

Property and value is separated by colon(:).

By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword):
      
      syntax
                  var objectname=new Object();  
       
       
By using an Object constructor

      * Need to create function with arguments. 
      * Each argument value can be assigned in the current object by using this keyword.
